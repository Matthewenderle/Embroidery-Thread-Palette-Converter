# Embroidery Thread Palette Converter

> A Python script to pull threads from https://threadcharts.com and generate Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop Color Swatches

This script was built to automate the task of creating Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase) files for several hundered embroidery thread brands and manufactures. It pulls from the online database hosted, by The Embroidery Nerds, to ensure that it is the most extensive library of ASE files.

## üêæ How to Install/Use the Swatches

Download the [repo's files](https://github.com/Matthewenderle/ThreadChart-to-Adobe-Swatch/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) from this repository and extract the zip archive. You'll see two folders called `adobe-swatches` and `corel-swatches`. Those folders have the relevant files needed for importing. Then follow the applicable section.

#### Adobe Illustrator
To import all the thread charts, create a folder called *Thread Charts* in `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS6 (64 Bit)\Presets\en_US\Swatches\` and copy all the swatches there. You can remove charts you don't need or want to make the list shorter.

Alternatively, with Adobe Illustrator open, you may click on the lower left icon in the *Swatches Panel* to select from installed swatches, and open the *thread_chart.ase* file that you'd like to import.

#### CorelDraw  
To import all the thread charts, create a folder called *Thread Charts* in `C:\Program Files\Corel\CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2022\Color\Palettes` and copy all the swatches there. You can remove charts you don't need or want to make the list shorter.
