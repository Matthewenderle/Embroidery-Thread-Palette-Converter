# ThreadChart to Adobe Swatch

> A Python script to pull threads from https://threadcharts.com and generate Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop Color Swatches

This script was built to automate the task of creating Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase) files for several hundered embroidery thread brands and manufactures. It pulls from the online database hosted, by The Embroidery Nerds, to ensure that it is the most extensive library of ASE files.
